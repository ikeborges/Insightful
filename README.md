# Insightful
A platform to manage information overwhelm and transform it into knowledge, inspiration and insight.

This project is being built following [Basecamp's Getting Real philosophy](https://basecamp.com/gettingreal)

## Project motivation

As a knowledge worker and hobbyist (designer, engineer, maybe writer), I need to manage information to transform it into knowledge, insight and new ideas, but existing tools don't fit on how I think, work and organize myself. **To know more about the process and solution definition, [check out the Wiki section](https://github.com/ikeborges/insightful/wiki)**.

The goal here is to develop a tool that:

- Makes me feel less anxious because of FOMO
- Makes me feel less mental fatigue to make things organized
- Centralizes information I store in several different apps
- Empowers me to merge ideas, thoughts and concepts to generate various creative outputs such as writing, new concepts, business ideas, etc.
- Helps me learn better and have a deeper understanding of my interests, thinking and improving my mental models and seeing where a piece of knowledge sits among the universe.
- Stores personal and sensitive documents privately
